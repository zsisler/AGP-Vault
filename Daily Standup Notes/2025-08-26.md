After watching a video TerrAnnie sent me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOIccUxlqF0), a key takeaway I took from it was that there are two major questions to get at in a standup:

_**What can we knock out today/this week/this sprint? and What is blocking us?**_

I added: _**What is our aim for the sprint? and What is being overlooked?**_

if we stick to this format I think standups will look like:

1. Walk the board - Start with UAT (closest thing to done), and work back to backlog keying in on high priority items
2. Discuss blockers - Using the feature we were using for standups but pointed toward blockers and work item creation
3. General Updates - Give Kurtis opportunity to share pertinent information and reminders
4. Team updates - Gives the team opportunity to mention valuable info to everyone else
5. Closure - Maybe a recap of items discussed and ending of the meeting
